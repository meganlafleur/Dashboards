**About**

Welcome to my little collection of Tableau and Power BI dashboards and reports. 

# Project 1: Tracking program KPIs in Power BI

This project was focused on tracking KPIs for multiple teams who complete a program renewal process each year for their clients. They wanted to track what statuses client renewals were in, including how many had been completed. They also wanted to filter based on client regions. 

**Data used**

Most of the data here was extracted daily from an excel file and stored in a SharePoint list that was being modified as team members processed client renewals. I also added to the model an Oracle table holding specific region information and joined it to existing data using a unique client identifier.

# Project 2: Data quality in Tableau

This report was requested for staff to track the increase of a specific data point that was being duplicated in their database. They wanted to see how fast the duplicates were growing, how quickly they were being removed, and which teams were removing them. This team did not want any filters in the report as they wanted a static file.
